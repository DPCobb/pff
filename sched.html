                        <p>The most awarded Mexican film in history -- with over 80 international accolades including
                        9 Ariel awards and an Un Certain Talent prize from the Cannes Film Festival -- Diego Quemada-
                        Diez's acclaimed debut feature tells the story of three teenagers from the slums of Guatemala
                        who travel to the USA in search of a better life. On their journey through Mexico they meet
                        Chauk, a Tzotzil teen from Chiapas who doesn’t speak Spanish. Travelling together in cargo
                        trains, walking on the railroad tracks, they will soon have to face a harsh reality. “La Jaula
                        De Oro” strikes a particularly resonant note for many residents of Peekskill, who are Guatemalan,
                         Ecuadorian, and Mexican immigrants.</p>

                            trains, walking on the railroad tracks, they will soon have to face a harsh reality. “La Jaula

                                through the eyes and ears of the American jukebox. The documentary features several vintage
                                jukeboxes playing the popular music of each of the musical periods: the Jazz Age, the Big Band
                                years, Rhythm & Blues, and early Rock & Roll. The narration guides you through the evolution
                                of jukebox technology, and shows how the music from each decade affected the design of the
                                jukebox and how it impacted American music culture.
